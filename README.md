# Worlds
This is a quick project I completed with a 3-day time-limit. It features a choose your own adventure game simulator using React. Current features include multiple End-Game Routes and many choices to make in-between.

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
npm install -g webpack
npm install
```

### Starting Up the App

```sh
npm run build (creates bundle.js)
npm start (starts up app on localhost:3000)
```
